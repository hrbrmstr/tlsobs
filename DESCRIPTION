Description: The 'Mozilla' 'TLS' 'Observatory' <https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze.html> 
    can be used to compare your site against the 'Mozilla' guidelines. You can use their 
    service or host your own. Both the central service and locally hosted services have 
    an 'API'. Either the central service or a local service can be queried from the 
    functions provided.
